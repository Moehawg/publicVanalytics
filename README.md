This repository contains a portion of the code used (or intended to be used) in the development of the Vanalytics Platform â€” an AI-powered system for automated volleyball analytics based on action recognition models applied to volleyball match videos.

The purpose of this repository is to support and inspire research and development efforts in the field of sports action recognition, while preserving the privacy and integrity of the core technologies that drive Vanalytics.

To maintain the competitive edge and proprietary nature of our platform, datasets, specific model architectures, and internally developed algorithms that are critical or unique to Vanalytics will not be published in this repository.
